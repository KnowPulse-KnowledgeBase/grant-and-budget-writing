## Please note

The Message Box Workbook is a free tool that can be helpful to move from talking about your science the same way you would write in a journal article. This is really helpful when writing grants, as funders have different objectives when deciding which projects to fund. And, for the most part, unless you're writing for a scientific journal where the audience would be well-versed on your topic, writers must be able to communicate in plain language.
