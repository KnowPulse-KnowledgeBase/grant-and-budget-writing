## Please note

The Message Box Workbook (COMPASS Science Communication, Inc., 2017) is a free tool that can be helpful to start talking about your science in a way that resonates with your audience. This is really helpful when writing grants, as funders have different objectives when deciding which projects to fund. As a grant writer, it's up to _you_ to know what those objectives are, and to write about your project in a way that makes sense to _them_. See examples of how other researchers are using the workbook, and practice working on your own message box.
