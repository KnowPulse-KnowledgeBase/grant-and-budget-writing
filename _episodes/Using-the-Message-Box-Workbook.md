Instead of re-inventing the wheel, I've found an organization that's dedicated to helping scientists articulate their message(s), and I'm pointing you there. It takes some time and dedication to work through their materials, but you will definitely benefit from the investment.

The following link will take you to a site dedicated to working through __The Message Box__ (Compass Science Communication, Inc., 2017). This is a free tool that can be helpful to start talking about your science in a way that resonates with your audience. This is really helpful when writing grants, as funders have different objectives when deciding which projects to fund. As a grant writer, it's up to _you_ to know what those objectives are, and to write about your project in a way that makes sense to _them_. See examples of how other researchers are using the workbook, and practice working on your own message box.
