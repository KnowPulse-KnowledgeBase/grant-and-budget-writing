## Please note

The Message Box Workbook is a free tool that can be helpful to move from talking about your science the same way you would write in a journal article. This is really helpful when writing grants, as funders have different objectives when deciding which projects to fund. As a grant writer, it's up to you to know what those objectives are, and to write about your project in a way that makes sense to _them_. See examples of how other researchers are using the workbook, and practice working on your own message box.
